How to setup certficate for the server
--------------------------------------

The ImageServer comes with a self-signed certificate named "ImageServer" which can installed 
by running InstallServerCert.bat. 

If you would like to use a different certificate, follow these steps:

1) Open "mmc" from the command line
2) Expand "Certificates (Local Computer)" If it's not present on the screen, follow these steps to add it :

	- Select "File" menu then "Add/Remote Snap-in"
	- Click "Add"
	- Select "Certificates" then "Add"
	- Select "Computer account" and "Next", then "Finish"


3) Right click on "Personal" and select "All tasks" then "Import"
4) Follow the screen to import your certificate
5) Modify <serviceCertificate> setting in the ImageServer configuration. The "findValue" should be set to the subject 
of your certificate.

Note: if your certifcate is not issued by a certificate authority, you may need to import it into the client's certificate store so that
it can authenticate the server.


Client Authentication
---------------------
The default setting of ImageServer authenticates the client based on its certificate. The client certificate must be
signed by a certificate authority (CA). Otherwise, the client certificate must be imported into the server CurrentUser Trusted People store
using mmc.

The client authentication can be disabled by setting the server certificateValidationMode to "None":
		
		<authentication certificateValidationMode="None"/>
