	///		LHS										RHS										Score
	///		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	///	1.	Tools.Image.Manipulation.Zoom			""										1

	/// A brief explanation of the logic:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>
	/// For backward compatibility, actions with a non-empty GroupHint, when compared to an 
	/// existing action in the store whose GroupHint="", the score is 1 because it is considered
	/// a better match than 2 actions whose GroupHints are non-empty and are completely different.
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// Actions with GroupHints that have similar components (separated by '.') are given a score
	/// equal to the number of (consecutive) matching components + 1.  The +1 accounts for the fact 
	/// that any number of equal components is a better score than the first example, whose score is 1.
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// Actions with completely different components are given an automatic score of zero (0).
	/// Two actions with GroupHints = "" are considered equal, so a score of 1 is given.
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// In this case, an existing action with an empty GroupHint is being matched to a non-empty
	/// GroupHint.  So, the LHS cannot be considered at all similar to RHS and the 
	/// score is automatically zero (0).
