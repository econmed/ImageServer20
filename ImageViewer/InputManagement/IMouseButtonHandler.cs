	/// The framework will look for this interface first on graphic objects (<see cref="ClearCanvas.ImageViewer.Graphics.IGraphic"/>) 
	/// in the current <see cref="IPresentationImage"/>'s SceneGraph (see <see cref="PresentationImage.SceneGraph"/>), then on 
	/// <see cref="ClearCanvas.Desktop.Tools.ITool"/>s belonging to the current <see cref="IImageViewer"/> 
	/// (via <see cref="IViewerShortcutManager.GetMouseButtonHandler"/>) and if an appropriate one is found, it will be given capture.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// An <see cref="IMouseButtonHandler"/> gets capture by returning true from <see cref="Start"/> indicating to the framework
	/// that it would like to handle mouse button input.  Similarly, capture is not released until <see cref="Stop"/> returns
	/// false, or <see cref="Cancel"/> is called by the framework.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When an <see cref="IMouseButtonHandler"/> has capture, all mouse input defined by the <see cref="IMouseButtonHandler"/> interface
	/// is handled by the object with capture.  No other objects receive any input until capture is released.
